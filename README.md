# S4S

This project took place during our 2018 Summer School courses at Amsterdam University of Applied Science.
We were asked to use some tools (Entwine, Potree, Cesium, PDAL) to get a height map of the Netherlands, from datafiles retrieved online ().

In order to do that, we split the work in several parts:
1 - Get experience with the tools by visualizing a test dataset (Via Appia)
