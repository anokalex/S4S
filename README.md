This project took place during our 2018 Summer School courses at Amsterdam University of Applied Science.
We were asked to use some tools (Entwine, Potree, Cesium, PDAL) to get a height map of the Netherlands, from datafiles retrieved online ().

In order to do that, we split the work in several parts:

1 - Get experience with the tools by visualizing a test dataset (Via Appia)

2 - Create Python scripts to retrieve the datafiles from the website

3 - Write Bash scripts to automatize the conversions of the files (with the tools)

4 - Write a script to launch a web server, to be able to visualize the result (with Cesium) - NOT POSSIBLE

5 - Visualize the data with Potree (not implemented)

Tools: 

Entwine - https://entwine.io/

Cesium - https://cesiumjs.org/

PDAL - https://pdal.io/
